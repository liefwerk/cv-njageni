# Curriculum Vitae of Nathanael Jageni

This contains all the code for my online curriculum vitae. Hosted on Netlify.

## :question: How was it made ?

It's made using **Node**, **Eleventy**, **TailwindCSS** and **Alpine.js**. This is known as the TEA Stack.

### Node and Eleventy

I mainly use *Node* and *npm* to work on web based projects. This provides a basic structure and access to several packages for developing on my local machine.

*Eleventy* is a straighforward static site generator. I chose it because it's got some community and looks like an amazing tool to manage my static CV content.

### :sparkles: TailwindCSS

Working with *TailwindCSS* is extremely quick - this is the right tool for a quick prototype or a side-project. This website was initially made in one afternoon using basic *HTML5* and Tailwind for shaping the structure.

## :red_book: What did your learn making it ?

This was my first project using *Eleventy*. What I mostly learned was working within a tight time window (4 hours) for making a basic static website and a structure that can be improved in the future.

## How do I run it on my computer ?

- `npm i` to build the `node_modules` folder
- `npm run dev` to boot up a dev server and start building
- `npm run build` when you're ready to build a production bundle

## :watch: What comes next ?
What comes next is the addition of a blog part at `nathanaeljageni.fr/posts/...`.
